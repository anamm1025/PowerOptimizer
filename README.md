# PowerOptimizer

(Academic project worked in a group of 4 people)

The projectâ€™s main focus is to optimize the energy consumption in a household/building.
Through this power optimization system, the power of electrical devices will be controlled wirelessly by smart phones (android) over Wi-Fi,
as well as automatically through the use of intelligent algorithms and sensors.
Technologies used for this purpose are arduino micro-controller, Google Cloud Messaging and Sharp IR sensors.
Database is also maintained to keep record of the state of devices of all the rooms of a building and other related information.
Android app will communicate with arduino over internet and arduino in turn will change the state of the devices. Also sharp IR sensors on the door of each room will 
detect human presence and through the algorithm the count of human inside a room will be kept. In this way devices can be automatically turned on if someone enters 
the room, and will be turned off if room gets empty.
